  Error Description

  Issue Context

  1. Performed clean deployment (removed volumes and redeployed)
  2. Created new trv-services organization successfully
  3. Configured agbot to serve multiple orgs (IBM, myorg, trv-services)
  4. AgBot successfully queries business policies and discovers nodes
  5. Agreement initiation fails with database constraint error
  6. Workload usage record created with ReqsNotMet: true

  Specific Error Log Entry

  E1118 20:12:46.202141       8 agreementbot.go:1489] AgreementBotWorker
  Error claiming an unowned partition, error: pq: null value in column
  "secret_exists" of relation "secrets_pattern_3" violates not-null
  constraint

  Additional Context

  - Error repeats every ~60 seconds
  - AgBot can see and query business policies correctly
  - AgBot identifies compatible nodes successfully
  - Agreement proposal begins but fails at partition claim step
  - Database appears healthy otherwise (accepts connections, basic queries
  work)

  Questions for Product Team

  1. Is this a known issue with Exchange 2.153.0 + AgBot 2.32.0?
  2. Is there a database migration script that should run after deployment?
  3. Could this be related to the -testing suffix on the Exchange image?
  4. Are there any workarounds for the secret_exists column constraint?
  5. Should we downgrade to specific version combinations?
